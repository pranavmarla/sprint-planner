# Sprint Planner

This was an attempt to create a program that, given a list of stories (eg. JIRA stories) and a list of sprints in which to complete those stories, would optimally schedule the stories keeping in mind how important the stories are, how big they are, whether they have any deadlines, whether they depend on other stories, etc.
